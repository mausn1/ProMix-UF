# Promix_UF, my first website
This website was made for a high school project and one of the first websites I have ever made. <br />
This project might not adhere to my nowadays standards but simply worked at the time. I do although think this project was a good experience. <br />
The purpose of this website was to service our hobby company where one would order tea.
